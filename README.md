# 🎓 LAUSD Public School Equity Analysis

This project investigates **equity and fairness** in school seat access within the **Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)** using 2018–2019 public datasets from the LAUSD Open Data Portal. Through structured SQL analysis, we uncover how a student’s **ZIP code** or **program choice (e.g., Dual Language)** may impact their chances of receiving a seat offer — highlighting gaps that data-driven policy could address.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To use SQL-based querying and regional education data to answer critical equity-related questions across LAUSD, focusing on:
- Seat allocation disparities by **geographic location**
- Admission inequities between **Dual Language** and **General Program** applicants

The ultimate goal is to provide **actionable insights** for policymakers and school administrators striving for fairer educational access.

## 🧩 Problem Statements Explored

### 1. **Are Students in Certain ZIP Codes Systematically Underserved in School Seat Offers?**  
Analyzes whether students from specific ZIP codes experience disproportionately low acceptance rates and highlights underserved neighborhoods.

### 2. **Do Dual Language Program Applicants Face Disparities in Admissions Compared to General Applicants?**  
Investigates whether students applying under the Dual Language category are systematically disadvantaged, and where these inequities are most visible.

## 🔎 Why This Matters

Public education should offer **equal opportunity**, regardless of where a student lives or the language program they apply to. By surfacing hidden patterns in application and offer outcomes, this project supports more **transparent, accountable**, and **inclusive** decision-making.
