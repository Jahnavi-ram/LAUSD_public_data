# LAUSD Public School Equity Analysis

This project explores equity and fairness in public school access within the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), using real datasets from LAUSD's open data portal. The focus is on uncovering potential disparities and imbalances in how students of different backgrounds, zip codes, or programs experience the application and seat offer process.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to use SQL-based analysis to answer key equity-related questions within LAUSD, covering access patterns, seat distribution, program fairness, and outcome predictors. The insights generated from this data could help identify underserved areas or groups and inform strategies for more equitable education access.

## Problem Statements

1. **Are Students in Certain Zip Codes Systematically Underserved in School Seat Offers?**
2. **How Does Chronic Absenteeism Influence Graduation and Dropout Rates Across High Schools?**
3. **Do Dual Language Program Applicants Face Disparities in Admissions Compared to General Applicants?**
4. **Is There a Gender Imbalance in Seat Offers Within High-Demand Magnet and Gifted Programs?**

These questions were chosen to reflect key concerns that LAUSD and its stakeholders care about — such as access equity, geographic fairness, program-level disparities, and long-term student outcomes. The project aims to analyze trends that may not be visible through surface-level metrics.

## Tools Used

* **Excel**: Initial data exploration and cleaning
* **PostgreSQL**: Database management and SQL querying
* **pgAdmin**: GUI for PostgreSQL interactions
* **Data Sources**: LAUSD Open Data Portal (2018–2019 public datasets)

Each problem statement is documented in its own file with:

* Clear question breakdown
* Data transformation and cleaning steps
* SQL queries
* Key findings and insights

This is an individual capstone-style project to strengthen skills in data cleaning, SQL, equity analysis, and public sector datasets.
