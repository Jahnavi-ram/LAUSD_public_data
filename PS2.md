## üîç Step-by-Step Data Preparation

### Step 1: Understanding the Columns

We selected the following relevant columns:

### Step 2: Cleaning in Excel

- Removed unnecessary columns (cost center codes, IDs)
- Renamed all headers to lowercase `snake_case` format
- Replaced missing zip codes with `NULL` where needed  
- Dropped rows with missing or irrelevant `program_name`
- Ensured data types were correct (zip as string, offers/applications as integer)
