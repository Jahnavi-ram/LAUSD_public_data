# Problem Statement 2: Do Dual Language Program Applicants Face Disparities in Admissions Compared to General Applicants?

This analysis investigates whether students applying to **Dual Language (DL) programs** in LAUSD schools face different acceptance outcomes compared to general applicants. The focus is on exploring potential equity gaps based on language program participation — particularly whether **"ApplicantDualLanguage = Yes"** applicants are systematically disadvantaged in admissions.

---

## 🎯 Key Insights Sought

- Do Dual Language applicants have **lower acceptance rates** than general applicants?
- Are they **underrepresented** in high-demand schools or certain communities?
- Is there a difference in **acceptance by school type** (e.g., magnet vs. non-magnet)?
- Can LAUSD identify areas needing **program expansion** or **policy clarification**?

---

## 📢 Potential Recommendations for LAUSD

- Expand seat capacity or locations for **high-demand DL programs**.
- Clarify **eligibility and prioritization policies** for DL vs. non-DL applicants.
- Investigate schools or ZIPs with persistent **disparities** in DL acceptance.
- Ensure **bilingual/multicultural access equity** across communities.

## 📂 Dataset Used

**Name:** Applications and Seat Offers by Applicant Dual Language Status (2018–2019)  
**Source:** LAUSD Open Data Portal  
**Format:** CSV

This dataset includes:
- Applicant program and school information
- ZIP code and community of school
- Whether the student was a Dual Language applicant

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Excel** – Data cleaning and selection  
- **PostgreSQL** – Analysis-ready querying  
- **pgAdmin** – Query interface

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Data Preparation

### Step 1: Understanding the Columns

We selected the following relevant columns:
- `program_name` – Name of the applied program  
- `school` – Name of the school applied to  
- `school_type` – Type of school (e.g., DUAL LANGUAGE, MAGNET, ELEMENTARY)  
- `community_of_schools` – Community or region the school belongs to  
- `zip_code` – Location-based analysis  
- `dual_language` – Indicates whether applicant is in the Dual Language track (`Yes` or `No`)  
- `applications` – Number of applications from this group  
- `seat_offers` – Number of offers extended to this group

### Step 2: Cleaning in Excel

- Removed unnecessary columns (cost center codes, IDs)
- Renamed all headers to lowercase `snake_case` format
- Replaced missing zip codes with `NULL` where needed  
- Dropped rows with missing or irrelevant `program_name`
- Ensured data types were correct (zip as string, offers/applications as integer)

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Importing to PostgreSQL

We created the following table in PostgreSQL to store the cleaned Dual Language admissions dataset:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dual_language_applications (
    program_name TEXT,
    school TEXT,
    school_type TEXT,
    community_of_schools TEXT,
    zip_code VARCHAR(5),
    dual_language TEXT,
    applications INT,
    seat_offers INT
);
```
---
### Query 1: Total Applications – Dual vs Non-Dual

**Purpose:**
Understand the scale of Dual Language program interest compared to General applicants.

**SQL:**

```sql
SELECT
  dual_language,
  SUM(applications) AS total_applications
FROM
  public.dual_language_applications
GROUP BY
  dual_language;
```

---
**Output:**

| dual\_language | total\_applications |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| No             | 150,439             |
| Yes            | 10,973              |

**🧠 Insight:**
Only **6.8% of total applications** were to Dual Language programs, while over **93% were to General programs**. This suggests that while demand for Dual Language programs exists, it remains a niche offering. LAUSD may want to investigate whether the limited uptake is due to **availability**, **awareness**, or **barriers to access** — especially if equity is a concern.

### 🧪 Query 2: Total Seat Offers – Dual vs Non-Dual

**Purpose:** See if Dual Language applicants receive proportionate offers compared to general program applicants.

```sql
SELECT
  dual_language,
  SUM(seat_offers) AS total_seat_offers
FROM
  public.dual_language_applications
GROUP BY
  dual_language;
```

**Output:**

| dual\_language | total\_seat\_offers |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| No             | 30185               |
| Yes            | 1600                |

**Insight:**

* Dual Language applicants received **1,600** seat offers.
* Non-Dual applicants received **30,185** seat offers.
* While Dual Language applicants made up **\~6.8%** of total applications (from Query 1), they received only **\~5%** of total offers.

This suggests a potential **underservice or bottleneck** in Dual Language program placements. LAUSD may need to review whether available seats in such programs meet demand, and whether placement policies unintentionally limit access for Dual Language applicants.

### Query 3: Acceptance Rate – Dual vs Non-Dual

**Purpose:** Identify whether Dual Language applicants are less likely to receive offers.

**SQL:**

```sql
SELECT
  dual_language,
  SUM(seat_offers) AS total_offers,
  SUM(applications) AS total_applications,
  ROUND(
    (SUM(seat_offers)::DECIMAL / NULLIF(SUM(applications), 0)) * 100,
    2
  ) AS acceptance_rate_percent
FROM
  public.dual_language_applications
GROUP BY
  dual_language;
```

**Output Summary:**

| Dual Language | Total Offers | Total Applications | Acceptance Rate (%) |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| No            | 30,185       | 150,439            | 20.06               |
| Yes           | 1,600        | 10,973             | 14.58               |

**Insight:**
Dual Language applicants have a lower acceptance rate (**14.58%**) compared to general applicants (**20.06%**). This suggests that Dual Language students may be at a disadvantage in the admissions process and merit closer examination by LAUSD to determine if program availability or policy gaps are contributing factors.

**Equity Recommendation:**
LAUSD should investigate:

* Whether sufficient seats are allocated to Dual Language programs.
* If demand outpaces supply in specific regions or language tracks.
* Policy mechanisms ensuring fair access to bilingual opportunities.
