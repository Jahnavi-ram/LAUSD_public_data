# Problem Statement 1: Are Students in Certain Zip Codes Systematically Underserved in School Seat Offers?

This file documents the complete process for exploring potential geographic disparities in school seat allocation based on student zip codes within the LAUSD school system. The goal is to uncover whether students from specific areas are receiving disproportionately fewer seat offers, despite applying in large numbers.

## Dataset Used

**Dataset Name:** Applications and Seat Offers by Applicant Zip Code (2018–2019)
**Source:** LAUSD Open Data Portal
**Format:** CSV

This dataset contains information on:

* The number of applications submitted from each student zip code
* The number of seat offers received
* The program/school applied to
* School location zip codes

## Tools Used

* **Excel:** For initial data inspection and cleaning
* **PostgreSQL:** For querying and deeper analysis
* **pgAdmin:** For GUI-based SQL interaction

---

## Step 1: Understanding the Columns

After reviewing the raw dataset in Excel, the following columns were identified as most relevant:

* `Program Name` – Name of the academic program
* `School Name` – Name of the school
* `School Zip Code` – Zip code of the school or program location
* `Applicant Zip Code` – Zip code of the student applying
* `Applications` – Number of applications received from that zip code
* `Seat Offers` – Number of seat offers given

The rest of the columns (e.g., district info, school codes, geographic descriptions, lat/long, etc.) were dropped as they were either redundant or not useful for this specific problem.

---

## Step 2: Cleaning in Excel

### a. Column Selection

We filtered out unnecessary columns and retained only the ones listed above.

### b. Renaming Columns

To make the dataset SQL-friendly, we renamed the columns to lowercase, snake\_case format:

| Original Column Name | Renamed Column      |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| SCode                | program\_name       |
| ApplySchoolType      | school\_type        |
| ApplyZipCode         | school\_zipcode     |
| ApplicantZipCode     | applicant\_zipcode  |
| Applications         | applications\_count |
| SeatOffers           | seat\_offers        |

### c. Handling Missing Values

* We found some rows where `program_name` was listed as `NA`. These rows were removed because program-level analysis was core to our questions.
* A few records were found with missing `applicant_zipcode`. We chose to keep them by replacing with `NULL` values, as the rest of the row still carried important application info.

### d. Data Type Validation

* Confirmed that zip codes are in proper 5-digit format.
* Ensured `applications_count` and `seat_offers` are numeric.

### e. Final Cleaned CSV

Saved the cleaned version as `lausd_zipcode_cleaned.csv`.

---

## Step 3: Importing to PostgreSQL

### a. Database Setup

* Created a new database called `lausd`

### b. Table Creation

Created a table named `zipcode_insights` using the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zipcode_insights (
    program_name TEXT,
    school_name TEXT,
    school_type TEXT,
    school_zipcode VARCHAR(5),
    applicant_zipcode VARCHAR(5),
    applications_count INT,
    seat_offers INT
);
```

### c. Data Import

* Used the pgAdmin import tool to upload `lausd_zipcode_cleaned.csv` into the `zipcode_insights` table.
* Validated the upload with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM zipcode_insights LIMIT 10;
```

* Verified record count and schema match.

---

The dataset is now successfully cleaned, transformed, and stored in SQL for further analysis. Next, we will begin answering equity-related questions using structured SQL queries to reveal any patterns of geographic underrepresentation.




## 🧪 Query 1: Top Applicant ZIP Codes by Number of Applications

### 🎯 Purpose  
This query identifies which student ZIP codes generated the highest number of school applications. It helps us locate areas with the greatest demand for school seats — a foundational step to uncovering any mismatch between applications and offers.

---

### 🧾 SQL Code

```sql
SELECT 
    applicant_zipcode,
    SUM(applications_count) AS total_applications
FROM 
    zipcode_insights
WHERE 
    applicant_zipcode IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    applicant_zipcode
ORDER BY 
    total_applications DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### 📊 Output Summary

| Rank | Applicant ZIP Code | Total Applications |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 90044              | 4,253              |
| 2    | 91342              | 4,134              |

### 🧠 Insight & Interpretation

This output surfaces the ZIP codes from which LAUSD received the highest volume of school applications in 2018–2019. These ZIP codes represent areas of **concentrated applicant activity**, which may reflect:

- Larger student populations  
- Greater interest in specialized programs  
- Lower perceived quality of default neighborhood schools  

However, it's important to note that **application volume alone does not indicate inequity**. A ZIP code may have high application numbers but also a proportionate number of seat offers. Therefore, this query simply helps establish a **baseline of demand** — a crucial first step before we assess **how supply (seat offers) compares**.

---


## 🧪 Query 2: Top Applicant ZIP Codes by Number of Seat Offers

### 🎯 Purpose  
This query identifies which student ZIP codes received the highest number of **seat offers** from LAUSD. By comparing this to application volume (from Query 1), we begin to explore whether areas with high demand are also being proportionately served — or if certain ZIP codes are favored in the offer process.

---

### 🧾 SQL Code

```sql
SELECT 
    applicant_zipcode,
    SUM(seat_offers) AS total_seat_offers
FROM 
    zipcode_insights
WHERE 
    applicant_zipcode IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    applicant_zipcode
ORDER BY 
    total_seat_offers DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### 📊 Output Summary

| Rank | Applicant ZIP Code | Total Seat Offers |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 90065              | 969                |
| 2    | 91342              | 957                |
| 3    | 91402              | 858                |

### 🧠 Insight & Interpretation

This output highlights the ZIP codes whose applicants received the highest number of seat offers in 2018–2019. Notably:

- Some ZIP codes like **91342**, **91402**, and **90003** appear in both the **top applications list (Query 1)** and **top seat offers list**, suggesting balanced supply-demand dynamics in those areas.
- **90065** appears at the top of this list but was **not among the top 10 applicant ZIP codes** — this could indicate a high seat offer rate relative to a lower application volume, worth exploring in future queries.

These results serve as a **supply-side baseline**. They don’t yet tell us whether the allocation was fair, but they do show **where seats are flowing most heavily**. In combination with Query 1, we now have both sides of the picture — demand and supply — to begin measuring equity gaps.

---


## 🧪 Query 3: Acceptance Rate by Applicant ZIP Code (Min 10 Applications)

### 🎯 Purpose  
This query calculates the **seat offer rate** for each applicant ZIP code — i.e., the percentage of applications that resulted in offers. It introduces a basic equity lens to understand how effectively students from different areas are being placed. By limiting to ZIP codes with **at least 10 applications**, we filter out statistical noise and focus on meaningful patterns.

---

### 🧾 SQL Code

```sql
SELECT 
    applicant_zipcode,
    SUM(seat_offers) AS total_offers,
    SUM(applications_count) AS total_applications,
    ROUND(
        (SUM(seat_offers)::DECIMAL / NULLIF(SUM(applications_count), 0)) * 100, 
        2
    ) AS acceptance_rate_percent
FROM 
    zipcode_insights
WHERE 
    applicant_zipcode IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    applicant_zipcode
HAVING 
    SUM(applications_count) >= 10
ORDER BY 
    acceptance_rate_percent DESC;
```

### 🧠 Insight & Interpretation

This output ranks ZIP codes based on **acceptance rate** (seat offers ÷ applications), revealing areas where students are most likely to secure school placements. Key observations:

- **90065** stands out with both **high application volume and top acceptance rate** (41.71%), suggesting strong placement success.
- Several ZIP codes with moderate applications (e.g., 90501, 90717) also show relatively favorable offer rates.
- ZIP codes like **90042 and 90255**, while submitting thousands of applications, see lower acceptance percentages — potentially hinting at **supply-demand mismatches** or reduced opportunity rates.

This query forms the foundation for identifying **underserved ZIP codes** — those with **high demand but disproportionately low success** — which will be explored in the next query.

---


## 🧪 Query 4: ZIP Codes with Lowest Acceptance Rates (Min 10 Applications)

### 🎯 Purpose  
This query identifies ZIP codes with the **lowest acceptance rates** — i.e., areas where students are significantly less likely to receive a seat offer, despite having submitted at least 10 applications. It filters out statistical noise and flags **potentially underserved regions** for deeper analysis or policy attention.

---

### 🧠 Insight & Interpretation

This output brings attention to ZIP codes where **educational opportunity may be falling short**. Despite students applying in reasonable numbers, their chances of securing a seat remain very low.

- **5 ZIP codes received zero seat offers** despite receiving **10+ applications** — this is a potential red flag for systemic exclusion or lack of seat availability.
- ZIP codes like **90262, 90301, and 90272** show **acceptance rates below 7%**, far below average.
- These results should be cross-checked with program or school availability, geographic access, and district priorities to understand **why placement success is so limited**.

This query is foundational in spotting inequity — areas that are **engaged** but not being **served**. It can guide interventions like program expansion, transportation planning, or targeted outreach.

---

### ⏭️ Next Step

In the next query, we’ll identify ZIP codes with the **widest numeric gap between applications and seat offers** — helping us spotlight the **largest absolute inequities** in demand vs supply.
