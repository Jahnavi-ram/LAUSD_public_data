# Problem Statement 1: Are Students in Certain Zip Codes Systematically Underserved in School Seat Offers?

This file documents the complete process for exploring potential geographic disparities in school seat allocation based on student zip codes within the LAUSD school system. The goal is to uncover whether students from specific areas are receiving disproportionately fewer seat offers, despite applying in large numbers.

## Dataset Used

**Dataset Name:** Applications and Seat Offers by Applicant Zip Code (2018–2019)
**Source:** LAUSD Open Data Portal
**Format:** CSV

This dataset contains information on:

* The number of applications submitted from each student zip code
* The number of seat offers received
* The program/school applied to
* School location zip codes

## Tools Used

* **Excel:** For initial data inspection and cleaning
* **PostgreSQL:** For querying and deeper analysis
* **pgAdmin:** For GUI-based SQL interaction

## Step 1: Understanding the Columns

After reviewing the raw dataset in Excel, the following columns were identified as most relevant:

* `Program Name` – Name of the academic program
* `School Name` – Name of the school
* `School Zip Code` – Zip code of the school or program location
* `Applicant Zip Code` – Zip code of the student applying
* `Applications` – Number of applications received from that zip code
* `Seat Offers` – Number of seat offers given

The rest of the columns (e.g., district info, school codes, geographic descriptions, lat/long, etc.) were dropped as they were either redundant or not useful for this specific problem.

## Step 2: Cleaning in Excel

### a. Column Selection

We filtered out unnecessary columns and retained only the ones listed above.

### b. Renaming Columns

To make the dataset SQL-friendly, we renamed the columns to lowercase, snake\_case format:

| Original Column Name | Renamed Column      |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Program Name         | program\_name       |
| School Name          | school\_name        |
| School Zip Code      | school\_zipcode     |
| Applicant Zip Code   | applicant\_zipcode  |
| Applications         | applications\_count |
| Seat Offers          | seat\_offers        |

### c. Handling Missing Values

* We found some rows where `program_name` was listed as `NA`. These rows were removed because program-level analysis was core to our questions.
* A few records were found with missing `applicant_zipcode`. We chose to keep them by replacing with `NULL` values, as the rest of the row still carried important application info.

### d. Data Type Validation

* Confirmed that zip codes are in proper 5-digit format.
* Ensured `applications_count` and `seat_offers` are numeric.

### e. Final Cleaned CSV

Saved the cleaned version as `lausd_zipcode_cleaned.csv`.

## Step 3: Importing to PostgreSQL

### a. Database Setup

* Created a new database called `lausd`

### b. Table Creation

Created a table named `zipcode_insights` using the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE zipcode_insights (
    program_name TEXT,
    school_name TEXT,
    school_type TEXT,
    school_zipcode VARCHAR(5),
    applicant_zipcode VARCHAR(5),
    applications_count INT,
    seat_offers INT
);
```

### c. Data Import

* Used the pgAdmin import tool to upload `lausd_zipcode_cleaned.csv` into the `zipcode_insights` table.
* Validated the upload with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM zipcode_insights LIMIT 10;
```

* Verified record count and schema match.

The dataset is now successfully cleaned, transformed, and stored in SQL for further analysis. Next, we will begin answering equity-related questions using structured SQL queries to reveal any patterns of geographic underrepresentation.
